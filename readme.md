# Isomorphic0String
This little project is about isomorphic string.Two strings are considered isomorphic when they can be mapped or transformed into one another by replacing each character in the first string with another character while preserving the order. This mapping between characters in both strings should maintain consistency and uniqueness, meaning that no two characters in the first string can be replaced by the same character in the second string, and vice versa
